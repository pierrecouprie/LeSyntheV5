# Le Synthé V5

Le Synthé V5 is an emulation of the mythic Synthi AKS constructed by EMS in 1972. You can found more information on the EMS offical web site: http://www.ems-synthi.demon.co.uk
You can found the original manuals on the excellent EMS Synthi blog:- VCS3 Users Manual: http://www.thesynthi.de/index.php?/archives/51-VCS-3-Users-Manual.html.- Synthi User Manual: http://www.thesynthi.de/index.php?/archives/4-Synthi-Users-Manual.html.
Do not hesitate to read them, they are a very good introduction to use Le Synthé V5.
As an emulation, you can found the original interface (devices and matrix board), and the approximate original sounds (the waveform was recorded from an original VCS3). As a software, Le Synthé V5 adds new improvements (control device, delay effect, oscillators with more important ranges, a better system to control the device, MIDI control, memory, etc.).
